# RAM-Limiter
Limits Application Ram Usage(specifically browsers/discord)

This application is loosely based on 0vm's Ram Limiter, found here: (https://github.com/0vm/RAM-Limiter)


His tool hasn't been updated in a while, so I figured I'd alter it to my tastes and make it very simple to use. There are 2 versions:

The GUI Version: After launching, simply delete the programs you don't want to limit/what you don't have.

The Barebones: Launch it, and it literally just limits Chrome, Discord, and Steam.




Installers are labeled, follow directions in the installer after running them.



YOU HAVE TO RUN THE LIMITER AS ADMINISTRATOR
