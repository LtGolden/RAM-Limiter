# RAM-Limiter
Limits Application Ram Usage(specifically browsers/discord)

This application is loosely based on 0vm's Ram Limiter, found here: (https://github.com/0vm/RAM-Limiter)


His tool hasn't been updated in a while, so I figured I'd alter it to my tastes and make it very simple to use. There are 2 versions:

The GUI Version: After launching, simply delete the programs you don't want to limit/what you don't have.

The Barebones: Launch it, and it literally just limits Chrome, Discord, Steam, and Overwolf.




Installers are labeled, follow directions in the installer after running them.



YOU HAVE TO RUN THE LIMITER AS ADMINISTRATOR

FYI:Some antiviruses mark this as dangerous due to "Unknown Publisher" or "Unknown/Suspicious Behavior"
I have tried to get rid of this, but can't really figure it out. The app does nothing but limit memory of the listed apps, which you can see if you look in the source code.
If you download it and can't find it, go to your Windows Defender/Other Antivirus and go to "Quarantined Threats"(or something similar), and restore the launcher if it flagged the download.
I apologize for the inconvenience.
