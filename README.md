# RAM-Limiter
Limits Application Ram Usage(specifically browsers/discord)

This application is heavily based on 0vm's Ram Limiter, found here: [https://github.com/0vm/RAM-Limiter](url) 


Using his code as a base, I put a few touches on it simply to refine it to my tastes. There are 2 versions:

The GUI Version: After launching, simply delete the programs you don't want to limit/what you don't have.

The Barebones: Launch it, and it literally just limits Chrome and Discord.




Installers are labeled, follow directions in the installer after running them.



YOU HAVE TO RUN THE LIMITER AS ADMINISTRATOR
